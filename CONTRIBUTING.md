# Contributions

## General Rules

1. Please only use open source programs (e.g. GIMP) so that this project may always be accessible to everyone.
2. if you want to contribute, follow the steps below.
3. If you wish to make a newer or older badge design,you can do that, but do not delete the original source files, in case someone likes those more.
  If you are working on a design of that kind, please add a new layered file that has the next version number in sequens. 
  If i wanted to add a newer intel design, i would look at the repo and see, that the latest version is `linux_intel-v1.xcf`, so i would make `linux_intel-v2.xcf` (or whatever your program outputs)
4. Any new fonts must be added to the fonts directory and linked to in the readme.

## How to make a contribution

2. make a branch named after whatever you wanna add
3. commit your changes to that branch

5. wait for a reply or an accepted PR
