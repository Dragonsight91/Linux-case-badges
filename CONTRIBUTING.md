# Contributions

## I wanna contribute, what do i do?

1. make a fork
2. make a branch named after whatever you wanna add
3. commit your changes to that branch
4. send a pull request from your branch to the `master` branch of this repo
5. wait for a reply or an accepted PR

That's it, there's nothing more to it. 
Personally, i wanna keep the designs, but i also want newer and older intel/AMD and maybe even NVIDIA badge designs to be encorporated.
If you wish to make a newer or older badge design,you can do that, but do not delete the original source files, in case someone likes those more.
